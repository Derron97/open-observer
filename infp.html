  <h1>INFP — The Empathic Dreamer</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The INFP (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving) personality type is often called “The Mediator” or “The Dreamer.” INFPs are introspective, empathetic and deeply idealistic. They seek authenticity and personal growth, and they have a rich inner world filled with imagination and meaning. Although they can appear reserved, INFPs are passionate about causes aligned with their values and will work quietly to bring positive change.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Key Traits</h2>
    <p><strong>• Idealistic & Authentic:</strong> INFPs have a strong sense of personal values and strive to remain true to themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>• Empathetic & Compassionate:</strong> They are sensitive to others’ feelings and often act as peacemakers.</p>
    <p><strong>• Imaginative & Introspective:</strong> INFPs enjoy exploring ideas and possibilities in their inner world.</p>
    <p><strong>• Flexible & Adaptable:</strong> They prefer to keep options open and are comfortable with spontaneity.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Famous INFPs</h2>
    <p><em>Real people:</em> William Shakespeare (playwright), J.R.R. Tolkien (author) and Audrey Hepburn (actress) are often cited as INFPs for their creative expression and humanitarian values ([www.indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/jobs-for-myers-briggs-personality-type#:~:text=perceiving.%5D%20Understanding%20your%20Myers,on%20Indeed%20Social%20Worker%20jobs)).</p>
    <p><em>Fictional characters:</em> Frodo Baggins from “The Lord of the Rings” and Anne Shirley from “Anne of Green Gables” exemplify the INFP’s blend of sensitivity, bravery and optimism.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Career Paths</h2>
    <p>INFPs thrive in careers that allow them to express themselves and help others. They often enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Writing & Literature – crafting stories and exploring human emotion.</li>
      <li>Counseling & Social Work – supporting individuals through empathetic listening.</li>
      <li>Art & Design – channeling creativity through visual or performing arts.</li>
      <li>Non‑Profit & Advocacy – championing causes that align with their values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Highly competitive or rigidly structured environments may feel draining for INFPs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Childhood Development</h2>
    <p>As children, INFPs are imaginative, sensitive and often introspective ([www.psychologyjunkie.com](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/recognizing-myers-briggs-personality-types-childhood/#:~:text=will%20give%20you%20a%20brief,who%20they%20are%21%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Begin)). They may enjoy solitary play or inventing stories and worlds. Encouraging them to share their feelings and interact with peers helps build confidence and social skills. Gentle guidance can help young INFPs balance their idealism with the realities of daily life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Micro‑Practice for INFP</h2>
    <p>Choose a brief creative outlet—write a short poem, draw a quick sketch or compose a melody—that expresses how you feel today. Afterwards, reflect on what this creative act reveals about your inner world. This practice nurtures your self‑expression and emotional awareness.</p>
  </div>
  <p style="margin-top:20px; font-size:0.85rem;">For self-awareness only — not a clinical assessment.</p>
